            "description" : "**Cora is currently being fostered in Houston, TX. Cora's local adoption fee, with local area pick up, is $300. Because foster and vet care are so expensive, the adoption fee is non-negotiable.**\n\nOur beautiful Cora came off the streets of Houston in really poor condition Ã¢\u0080\u0093 in fact, when we rescued her we thought the only thing we could do for her was peacefully let her go with some love and dignity. Much to our delight, our vet told us that everything wrong was superficial and we would be able to save her! After getting her healthy and up to weight, we are so excited to find her forever family for her! \n\nCora is a roughly 3-year old, 80-pound Boxer/American Bulldog mix. Because many apartment/condo management companies have restrictions against her breed, it is best to check about potential breed regulations prior to applying. Cora is an medium level activity and SMART girl who will be best suited in a family that can commit to proper exercise and socialization. She is amazing, but to be her best, she needs exercise and stimulation. \n\nCora currently lives with other dogs and LOVES having a playmates. Since she is a bigger girl, we would advocate she not live with small dogs just because of her size, she may inadvertently hurt a small companion. She has a high prey drive Ã¢\u0080\u0093 from her time surviving on the streets Ã¢\u0080\u0093 so she CANNOT live with cats. She would be great as a single dog or as an addition to a family with another active dog. \n\nCora has a great disposition and would be a great addition to a family with children who know how to be kind and respectful of animals. But with her size, we would advocate she be placed in a home with older children. \n\nCora is house and kennel trained and has done a great job of learning how to walk on her leash. She loves going on adventures with her foster family and is a great co-pilot in the car.  \n\nCoraÃ¢\u0080\u0099s ideal family will understand that she will take time and patience as she acclimates into her new life. She may have accidents, chew on things she is not supposed to, and bark in her kennel. It can take dogs a few weeks to properly acclimate to their new lives, so she is seeking a family that can give her this time and work with her on becoming an even more awesome dog than she already is. \n\nCora should be adopted by a family who plans to keep her indoors as part of a family - we do not adopt dogs into situations in which they will be left outside for extended periods of time unattended (for example, the entire work day).\n\nCora is fully vetted (spayed, microchipped, vaccinated)  and has no known allergies. Unfortunately because of CoraÃ¢\u0080\u0099s time on the street, she is heartworm positive. She has been started on a slow-kill heartworm protocol and the medication to continue her treatment will be provided by the rescue. This does not impact the quality of her life, itÃ¢\u0080\u0099s just something that needs consistency of medication until itÃ¢\u0080\u0099s cleared up. \n\nThe first step in our adoption process is to fill out an application via our website which you can access via the following link: https://reggiesfriends.org/adoptables/\n\nIf you have questions about Cora, please email us at adoptions@reggiesfriends.org for more information.",

See contact information below.\n\nMia is six and Lily is four. Mia looks more Maltese and Lily appears to have more Poodle in her. They are a bonded pair who must be adopted together. They were among the 44 dogs confiscated from a puppy mill in Southeast San Diego. They were in a windowless enclosure with no room to move around. They had ear mites and were covered with mange. We treated them and got them spayed.Their personalities are coming out as they become more secure in their foster home. Mia and Lily are very sweet girls but you have to start slow with them as they are fearful of new situations. Otherwise they are great with other dogs. They are both crate trained and are telling their foster mom when they need to go outside to go potty but they will need additional work with potty training.\n\nWe suggest a home with children over the age of 10 for this dog. This dog cannot be adopted out of state. Please see our home page for a list of our Saturday adoption sites. Every potential adopter is required to fill out an adoption application and the dog is placed in the home that would be most suitable for the dog. We do not place our dogs in homes with unfenced swimming pools. Generally we don't release the dogs at the adoption site that day except on occasion to former adopters. If you are interested in adopting this pair, please email FCIAdoptions@aol.com or call 619-466-9137.",

Fabio is a fun active dog and would do well to hike or jog with along with you or just have a fenced yard and plenty of play time.   He knows basic commands and is eager to please when a treat is his reward.  The hound in him thinks it would be fun to chase cats so he would do best without a cat in his life.  Fabio most enjoys spending time with his people.    Fabio is so friendly and happy to meet new people that when we rescued him from death row he had \"happy tail\"; as we call it.  He wagged is tail so hard in his kennel that the tail became damaged from banging on the kennel walls.  It required a partial amputation.  The surgery left him a cute quarter length tail so he still has plenty of tail to wag when he someday meets his forever family.  He is dreaming of that day!\n\nFabio is spending time at our sanctuary playing with other dogs in play yards and snoozin' out in the sun. Interested in meeting Fabio? Please email ayendes.care@gmail.com for more information. \n\nAll C.A.R.E rescue dogs are fully vaccinated, heartworm tested, spayed/neutered, worm/flea free, and dogs are microchipped!

I cannot have any visitors beforeÃÂ April 28th. You will need to fill out an online application and receive a phone call back from a staff member that everything is ok with the application prior toÃÂ April 28th. All family members and any dogs from the household need to be present at the time of the adoption.\n\nAdoption donation: $450\n\nWe open at 9 am Saturday mornings and we will be helping adoptions in the order of when they submitted an approved application to us. There will be a sign in sheet on the front door at 8:30 am so that we can pull applications for the people that arrive between 8:30-9am. Again, the order in which adoptions will come in to the shelter to see any adoptable dogs or cats first thing on Saturday mornings will be as to when the application was submitted to Animal House Shelter so there is no need to come to the shelter any earlier than 8:30 to sign in. This will be the procedure for people that arrive between 8:30-9am.\n\nAfter 9am, on Saturday mornings it will be first come, first serve after we help all of the adoptions that signed in between 8:30-9am. Most people submit general applications to us which do not specify a name or a particular litter they are interested in so there is no way for us to know until people arrive Saturday morning at 8:30 how many people are interested in a particular litter, puppy, kitten, cat or adult dog. We always have around 300 dogs & cats available for adoption and the adoption counselors will help you to find the right companion for your family! We look forward to meeting you!\n\nAll dogs are microchipped, neutered, current on all vaccines, heartworm tested and started on Tri Heart Plus & Vectra 3D.\n\nAdoptable Dogs:  http://www.animalhouseshelter.com/?page_id=343\n\n  The website www.animalhouseshelter.com is always kept 100% up to date with who is currently available and all new animals (40/week) are added to the site 2 weeks before their availability date to give you time to fill out your adoption application and get the family ready to come out to the shelter that day. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday!\nI would recommend if you havenÃ¢\u0080\u0099t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt.  The adoption counselors will be able to show you many  that would be a good fit for your family.  We do go in order of when you submitted your application with us.  So it is always best that you get your general application for any animal in with us as soon as possible.\nHere is the link to the Adoption Application: https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/adoption-application/\n \nThank you!\nAnimal House Shelter\n13005 Ernesti Road\nHuntley IL, 60142\nwww.animalhouseshelter.com\nOpen \nSunday, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday from 11 AM to 7 PM, \nTuesday from 11 am to 4 pm and \nSaturday's 9 AM to 7 PM. \n847-961-5541\n847-961-5537 fax\n\nConnect With Us:\n\"Like\" Us On Facebook!\nWatch Us On YouTube!\nFollow Us On Twitter! \n\nAdoption Application:  http://www.animalhouseshelter.com/index.php?page_id=287\n\nHow to Adopt: http://www.animalhouseshelter.com/?page_id=31\n\nDirections to Shelter:  http://www.animalhouseshelter.com/?page_id=31\n\nAdoptable Dogs:  http://www.animalhouseshelter.com/?page_id=343",

Abby and Lilly had a wonderful home for years until their owner passed away unexpectely.  Lucky for them, their ownerÃ¢\u0080\u0099s elderly father moved into their home to take care of them.  Now years laters their owner is in Hospice care so now Abby and Lily need a new furever home.\n\nAbby and Lilly are friendly pup about 10 years old.  They are docile, easy going and layed back.  They love nothing more than playing in the yard, going for walks and hanging out with you.\n\nThere is a lot to be said about an older dog, they have outgrown the urge to chew on things, they are not as rowdy as puppies and they appreciate just hanging out and keeping you company.\n\nAbby and Lilly would make wonderful loyal, low energy walking buddies for a nice family.  We are sure when you meet them, you will fall in love!\np>ÃÂ \nTHE BREED THIS PET IS LISTED AS IS OUR BEST GUESS AS WE HAVE NO BACKGROUND INFO ON WHO THE MOM OR DAD ARE. We do not have a shelter facility you can visit.  Our volunteers foster the dogs and pups in their private homes once they have been vetted and transported here. Please read our homepage to see how the adoption process works. If interested in adopting this pet, please e-mail FureverHomeDogRescue@gmail.com and request an adoption application. Please note we do not adopt puppies/dogs to homes where they will be alone all day. ",

They can be dogs, cats, exotics, birds. Their primary role is to provide their owners with emotional comfort. Emotional support animals can benefit a disabled individual psychologically. The basic gift of companionship and unconditional affection can be the therapy needed to counter a condition like debilitating depression or Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.\nESAs are protected under the Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA) and the Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA). People meeting the proper criteria are entitled to an ESA to assist them with life. The FHAA protects individuals by allowing ESAs to live with them regardless of breed (even with no pet policies). The ACAA protects individuals by allowing ESAs to fly with them in the cabin of an airplane without having to pay additional fees. ESAs are not required to be professionally trained. An owner can train the pet. A letter of need written by a mental health counselor may be required for those wanting to transport via plane or for landlords. For information regarding the legalities of ESA contact maggihall14@gmail.com.\n\nIf you can't find what you want at ARK go to the following and TRULY save a life.

            "description" : "What a pleasure to meet you!  I love meeting new people, new dogs, and new cats!  May I introduce myself?  My name is Jamboree and I'm four years old.  I'm not sure you can tell from my photos and you might be too polite to ask but I'm on the smaller side of average for a genteel Lab mix.  More about me?  My early days are a mystery that left me very occasionally skittish but the vast majority of my time is spent enjoying life.  I'm so good with other dogs.  I enjoy playing and hanging out and generally forging good relationships with all sorts of other dogs.  I'd love to have a canine friend in my new home.  Cats?  I am very good with kitties and I treat them with the utmost respect.  Besides playing with other dogs, admiring cats, and getting attention from people, my great pleasures include riding in the car and going on walks.  As you might imagine, I am an excellent companion in the car and do not display any of those shenanigans you sometimes see in unruly adolescents.  No, I am a lady and I conduct myself accordingly, both in the car and in the house.  I'm sure you realize you don't need to ask but I will confirm for you that I'm completely house trained and I use the doggie door like a pro.  No problem barking from me.  I am crate trained and enjoy napping in my crate but I am completely dependable in the house, too.  I can't remember the last time the door to my crate was closed.  If you are a dog lover who understands that sometimes a girl's past means she finds herself unsure once in a while, we should make a date to get together.  I can't wait to meet you!\n\n\nWe require an application, phone interview and home visit prior to adoption. We will not discuss a specific dog with an applicant until the adoption process is completed. Our adoption fee for dogs under 8 months is $300, dogs between 9 months and 7 years is $250 and our super seniors are $125. Please visit our website for more information. Thank you!",
